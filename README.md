## REQUIREMENTS

* PHP 7.x.x

>PHP Modules required

Modules (cli, curl, mbstring, pdo, mysql, gd, zip, xml, json,bcmath, ctype, dom, xml, openssl, tokenizer, zip)

* MySQL/MariaDB

* Composer

* NodeJS

* Git

To install `NodeJs`,`Git` and `MariaDB`, run the following 

```bash
$ sudo apt install mariadb-server nodejs git -y
```

## SETUP

Start by cloning this repository on your local machine

```bash
$ cd ~/my_projects_folder
$ git clone https://github.com/living-opensource-zambia/los-community.git
```

Change into the repository.

```bash
$ cd los-community
```

At this stage, you should have `composer` installed, if you do not have `composer`.
Do the following:

```bash
$ php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
$ sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
$ php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"
```

Inside of the los-community directory, install laravel dependencies by typing:

```bash
$ composer install
```

After installation of all dependenies, then copy `.env.example` file into `.env`, e.g:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Then generate a laravel key by typing:

```bash
$ php artisan key:generate
```

Then create an empty database and give it a name. For this example we have used `los_community` as our database name:

```bash
$ mysql -u username -p
....
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql> CREATE DATABASE los_community;
```

After creating the database, setup laravel to access your database from the [.env file](.env) by setting up the following parameters.

```.env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=los_community
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
```

You also need to setup emails and password to be used for the dummy users to be generated by the seeder.

```.env
ADMIN_EMAIL="arthur@kalikiti.net"
MEMBER_EMAIL="edwin.zimba@livingopensource.africa"
STUDENT_EMAIL="santos.chibenga@livingopensource.africa"
DEFAULT_PASSWORD="loss-community@home"
```

The above parameters are used in generating seeds in [UserDataSeeder.php](database/seeds/UserDataSeeder.php).

To populate your database, run the migrations with the seed option:

```bash
$ php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

Install the node dependencies, with the following command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

After that is done, you are ready to roll.

Run the two development servers, i.e laravel & npm by typing:

*Not* Run these in separate terminals 

Terminal 1:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

Terminal 2:

```bash
$ php artisan serve
```

You are all set now :joy:
